The big news these days is naturally the "US capture of Saddam Hussein(CNN.com Specials: Saddam Hussein Captured)":http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2003/saddam/. 

I can't help it, but seeing the footage of Saddam undergoing medical examination by US doctors remind me of the scientists examining the "Brain Bug(Brain Bug Close-Up)":http://www.stampede-entertainment.com/monstermakers/a-bug-6-l.html after it's capture in "Starship Troopers(IMDb: Starship Troopers (1997))":http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120201/. Weird stuff...
