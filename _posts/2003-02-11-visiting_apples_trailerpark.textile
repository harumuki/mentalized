<h2>Biker boyz</h2>

<a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/dreamworks/biker_boyz/" title="Biker Boyz trailer">The Fast and the Furious meets Boyz N the Hood</a>. The custom cars are replaced with custom motorcycles, Vin Diesel is replaced with Laurence Fishburne, the bitches and the bimbos are <a href="http://us.imdb.com/EGallery?source=ss&amp;group=0326769&amp;photo=CT-2242.jpg&amp;path=gallery&amp;path_key=0326769">still there</a>. 

<cite>"Biker boyz, we set our own rules"</cite> - or perhaps we'll grab them from another movie.

<h2>2 Fast, 2 Furious</h2>

Speaking of The Fast and the Furious it seems like the sequel is coming soon; <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/universal/2_fast_2_furious/">2 Fast, 2 Furious</a>. Please, I thought spelling words with numbers went out of fashion a couple of years ago. Apart from that, more from the same shelf. Fast vehicles, busty babes and no Vin Diesel (I wonder if his newfound stardom has made him too expensive) - sound familiar?
