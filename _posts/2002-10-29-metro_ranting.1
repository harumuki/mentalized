Since <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000051.html">everybody</a> <a href="http://www.sigurdsson.dk/archive/archive.asp?file=2002_10_01_archive.inc#85591307">else</a> <a href="http://www.genstart.dk/log/justblog.asp">seem</a> to be commenting on the newly opened <a href="http://www.m.dk">Copenhagen metro</a>, I might as well give my eurocents worth of comments:

To me as an individual the Metro is useless. There are no stations near where I live, nor does it run on any route that I'd regularly travel. Furthermore there are <a href="http://www.m.dk/fremtid.htm">no plans</a> to expand the Metro-net to my neighbourhood. So yes, I probably am biased when looking at the Metro as a whole.

To me as a citizen of Copenhagen the Metro seems like a waste of money. With it's very <a href="http://www.m.dk/kor_med_metroen/koreplan.htm">limited amount of stops</a> it accomodates a select few of the people in the city - too few to justify a train every third minute. The Metro may turn out to be a great addition to he city, if the "<a href="http://www.m.dk/etape4.htm">Cityring</a>" is established. The Metro people estimate this to happen not until at least 2010. With their trackrecord of estimating we're looking at a cityring and subsequent usable Metro in 2020. That's if it happens at all, and that's a pretty big if.
