Americans suck - they get to see Matrix Reloaded now, while I have to wait a week before it opens in the danish cinemas. Bullocks. I don't get that decision, why not launch at the same time worldwide? I can't seem to think of any reason to seperate the openings by a week, but then again, I generally don't understand the movie BigCos.

A bit of Matrix-related stuff:

* <a href="http://www.bradchoate.com/" title="Brad">Brad Choate</a> has given his site a pretty cool "matrix-over" (which I hate him for, but more on that some other day).
* <a href="http://www.pvponline.com/archive.php3?archive=20030512" title="PVP Online - Strip for Monday, 12th of May">PVP Online</a> has started what seems to be a week of Matrix-strips
* Warner and Ubi Soft are developing <a href="http://thematrixonline.warnerbros.com/" title="The Matrix Online">a real "the matrix"</a>.
