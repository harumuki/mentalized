"This addition(IMDb: Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle)":http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0305357/ to the ever-growing family of fast-cutting, wire-action, musicvideo-styled kind of action movies is a waste of time. Not even the cameos or the babe-factor of Cameron Diaz, Demi Moore, and Lucy Liu can make up for the incoherent and unexciting storyline.

Take my advice, spend 15 minutes in company with "three(Cameron Diaz)":http://images.google.com/images?q=%22cameron+diaz%22 "Google(Demi Moore)":http://images.google.com/images?q=%22demi+moore%22 "searches(Lucy Liu)":http://images.google.com/images?q=%22lucy+liu%22 while Prodigy blasts from your stereo, sprinkle with random glances to MTV, and you'll have experienced Charlies Angels: Full Throttle.
