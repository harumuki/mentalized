For no apparent reason, I just want to point out the fact, that my ticket for the <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0167261">The Two Towers</a> has been secured. Center seats, Imperial, 19th december, 21:40. Drool...

On a related note, I am contemplating buying the extended version of <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0120737">Fellowship of the Rings</a>. The extacy-like state of mind, that Anders <a href="http://www.legenden.dk/weblog/">seems to be in</a> after having watched it makes it hard to resist. Is it possible to perfect the perfected?
