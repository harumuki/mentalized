Of all the intersections in all the towns in all the world, the police had to stand at the one where I decided to skip the red light riding my bicycle to work this morning. That's worth 500DKK in case you're wondering.

Oh well, I can't really complain. I am fully aware that it's illegal, perhaps even reckless (although I'd like to be the judge of that). I made the choice and was unlucky. Besides, the score is still in my favor.
