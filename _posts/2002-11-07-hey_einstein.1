Wise words from PHP father <a href="http://www.lerdorf.com/tips.pdf">Rasmus Lerdorf</a>: <blockquote>"Don't over-architect things. If your solution seems complex to you, there is probably a simpler and more obvious approach. Take a break from the computer and go out into the big (amazingly realistic) room and think about something else for a bit."</blockquote>
