Danish gamingserver provider, <a href="http://www.boomtown.net">Boomtown</a> has a great way to keep their subscribers: Make it easy to subscribe (I was automagically transferred from their free trial to their payment solution without consenting), hard to unsubscribe. 

I have to give them a 12-digit numeric code, and some password that was given to me on some random piece of paper when I signed up a year ago which I can only retrieve by calling a non toll free number with a waiting line from here till eternity. This is in addition to the username and the password that have already identified me uniquely on their website.

Sigh
