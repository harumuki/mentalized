A conversation I had today with a longlost friend from back in my Amiga-days, inspired me to go through my archives, digging up music I made 10 years ago. I hereby give a selection to you, for your listening "pleasure" or amusement if you will. The quality is pretty crappy, but thats how it sounded on the Amiga.

<ul>
  <li><a href="/journal/archives/amigamusic/Diseased.mp3">Diseased</a></li>
  <li><a href="/journal/archives/amigamusic/NotEverSince.mp3">Not Ever  Since</a></li>
  <li><a href="/journal/archives/amigamusic/NoLimitRemix.mp3">No Limit (Remix)</a></li>
  <li><a href="/journal/archives/amigamusic/TimesOfDespair.mp3">Times of Despair</a></li>
</ul>

Go easy on me ;)
