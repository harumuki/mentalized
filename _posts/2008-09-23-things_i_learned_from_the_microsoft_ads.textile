# Windows is confusing and all about nothing - just like any episode of the Seinfeld show.
# "Microsoft needs to piggyback":http://daringfireball.net/linked/2008/09/17/msft-advertising on Apples creativity.
# Even though everyone and their brother use Windows, "group pressure":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkZdkHylJ3w isn't going to make me switch away from OS X.

Ah well, at least the "Gates/Seinfeld episodes":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afR5J7eskno were somewhat amusing.
