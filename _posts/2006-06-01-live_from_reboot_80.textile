Reporting live from Reboot 8.0. 5 minutes ago the official opening should have started. Hall A is slowly being filled. The concentration of Mac laptops is as high as ever. Thomas madsen Mygdal is taking pictures with cell phone. The bags we get with admission this year are actually pretty cool, instead of the paper bag of last year. We also got 2 t-shirts instead of one, totally worth it ;)
