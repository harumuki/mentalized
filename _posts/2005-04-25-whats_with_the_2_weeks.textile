What's with the "Remember me for 2 weeks" that's appearing on login pages? 37signals is "keen on 2 weeks(Ta-da List login)":http://www.tadalist.com/account/login. "Symphony(Symphony demo)":http://demo.symphony21.com/symphony/ uses 2 weeks too, I seem to recall "GMail(Gmail)":http://www.gmail.com doing the same, but there is no specified time now, so I might be mistaken.

I know about login cookies and all that, but I wonder why exactly 2 weeks? Why not longer?
