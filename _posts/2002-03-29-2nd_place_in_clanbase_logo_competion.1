The Urban Terror-Cup over at <a href="http://www.clanbase.com">ClanBase</a> needed a logo, so I decided to enter the competition. Voting for the best logo <a href="http://www.clanbase.com/news_league.php?nid=37717&lid=519">has ended</a>, and <a href="/files/hv/clanbase1.jpg">my entry</a> came in second place. Frankly, I feel that my logo wasn't fantastic although better than the competition - apparently 61 people thought otherwise.
