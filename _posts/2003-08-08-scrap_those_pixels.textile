Max Design's piece about <a title="Max Design - Ideal line length for content" href="http://www.maxdesign.com.au/presentation/em/">using ems to achieve an ideal line length for content</a> gave me an idea. Why not use em's for everything? 

Traditional fluid- and fixed-width designs often suffer from being garbled when the user in- or decreases the font-size. If you instead base your design on em's, your website will scale according to the users font setting, maintaining whitespace, linelengths, and the general feel you have chosen for your design.

In theory at least.

Apart from the obvious possible browser-compatibility issues and the fact that most image formats are pixelbased and will not scale in a decent way, there are likely to be some problems I am not seeing.

Perhaps I should just go ahead and make the change to my stylesheet and see how it works out; be an early adopter for once.
