Oh my... The ending credits for <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0120737">Fellowship of the Rings</a> is slowly moving across my television. I had totally forgotten how awesome that movie is. The introduction alone almost makes it worth buying the entire DVD; Cate Blanchetts voice over is simply amazing. Her pronunciation, her variation in speed, and shifting tone of voice in combination with Peter Jacksons fantastic images still sends shivers down my spine - gotta lova it.

Only problem is my television definatly does not do the movie (well, any movie actually) justice. It is far too small and gives everything a greenish hue - I guess I better buy a new one soon.
