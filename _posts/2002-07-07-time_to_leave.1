Right, the last bag is almost packed, and I think I am ready to take the journey to California. Few hours from now, I'll be sitting in a Boeing 747 enroute to L.A. and I won't return for about 4 weeks. Damn, I'm looking forward to this vacation, and damn, I feel entitled to it :)

So long, and thanks for all the fish
