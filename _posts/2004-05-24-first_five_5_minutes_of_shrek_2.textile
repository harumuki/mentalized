Oi, now that's what I call a teaser: "The first 5 minutes of Shrek 2(Shrek 2 - The First 5 Minutes)":http://www.shrek2.com/firstfive.html is available for viewing. And to no surprise picks up where the first movie left off and follows the same path with the same look, the same splendid humour, and numerous references to movies and even more fairy tales. Good stuff.
