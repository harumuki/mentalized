Mental note to self (and everyone reading here): If using "FreeTDS":http://www.freetds.org/ on "OS X":http://www.apple.com/macosx/ and you cannot connect to your "MS SQL Server":http://www.microsoft.com/sql/default.mspx using iodbctest , but you can con using tsql, and your TDSDUMP logfile contains 

bc. tds_iconv_info_init: client charset name "" unrecognized

make sure you have put

bc. client charset = UTF-8 

into your freetds.conf - _not_

bc. client charset = utf-8

Note the case difference.

I can't believe the amount of hours I have wasted setting up FreeTDS and ODBC connectivity on various systems by now - and still I get bit by crap like the above.
