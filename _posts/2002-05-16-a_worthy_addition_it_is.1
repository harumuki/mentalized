Wow. Last night I had the undivided pleasure to experience George Lucas' most recent addition to the everexpanding Star Wars universe, <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0121765">Attack of the Clones</a>. Every doubt I have had after the mediocre <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0120915">first prequel</a>, was effectively put to shame. George Lucas manages to correct the mistakes from the first movie, while telling an intriquing story spiced with staggering action sequences and breathtaking scenery. The movie gives us a glimpse into the more shady depths of the governmentplanet of Coruscant and it elevates the plot of the prequels into a state that makes it very hard waiting to see how it all will become resolved 3 years from now.
