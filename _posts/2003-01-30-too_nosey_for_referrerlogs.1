Heh, going through referrerlogs is kind of fun in a geeky sort of way. Doing this I stumbled across an odd referrer to <a href="http://www.mentalized.net/journal/archives/technology/tweaking_the_website/index.asp#000112" title="Tweaking the website">my previous post</a>. A little digging revealed that the visitor came from a browserbased email reader.

In other words, someone has sent the URL of one of my entries to somebody else, who followed the link to my entry. Why anyone is sending emails about my entries around the net I dunno, and it annoys the hell out of me - even though it really doesn't matter one bit.

I guess I'm just too nosey to scrutinize referrerlogs.
