March has arrived, as has the next chapter in <a href="http://www.intothematrix.com/" title="What is the Animatrix">the Animatrix</a>, called "Program".

Apart from being a cool little flick, there isn't really anything interesting or revolutionary about it. Some anime action in a Matrix-setting, shrug, <a href="http://www.intothematrix.com/rl_cmp/animatrix_site_prog_640.html" title="Program in High bandwidth version">go watch it</a>.
