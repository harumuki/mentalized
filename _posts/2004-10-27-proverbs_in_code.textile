English proverbs represented as code. If you can guess what they are, I must have made them at least somewhat correct:

bc. if (book.page != book.cover) {
  judge(book);
}

bc. if chickens.state == "hatched" {
  return chickens.count;
}

bc. if (bodyPart.isClass(Hand)) {
  if (bodyPart != self.feeder) {
    self.bite(bodyPart)
  }
}

bc. while true {
};
echo("die");

bc. def understandRecursion():
  understandRecursion()

bc. while (self.proficiency(skill) < masterLevel) {
  self.practice(skill);
}

bc. if count = 2 then
  result := "company"
else if count = 3
  result := "crowd";
