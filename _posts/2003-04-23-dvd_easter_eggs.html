<p>At a dinner during easter my cousins husband-to-be pointed out to me, that the MTV Music Award spoof of the council-scene from Fellowship of the Rings was accessible on the extended version DVD by following some obscure keypresses.</p>

<p>He instructed me to look it up using Google. Behold! Google sent me to 
<a title="DVD Easter Eggs" href="http://www.dvdeastereggs.com/main.php">DVD Easter Eggs</a> that lists over thousand <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/Easter-egg.html" title="Jargon File: Easter egg">Easter Eggs</a>. Feel free to call me ignorant, but I never realized that DVDs containing this were this widespread.</p>
