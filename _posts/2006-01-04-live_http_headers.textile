I've been sorely missing my Live HTTP Headers extension ever since upgrading to Firefox 1.5 rendered it unusable. Turns out there actually is a new version out which is compatible with Firefox 1.5 - something the extension upgrading system failed to tell me. 

If you like me failed to discover this new version, "head over to mozdev and grab it":http://livehttpheaders.mozdev.org/
