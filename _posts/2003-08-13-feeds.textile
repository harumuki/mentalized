I provide the following feeds for your syndication pleasure:

* <a href="/journal/entries_excerpts.xml" title="Excerpt of entries (RSS 2.0)">Journal: Entry excerpts only</a>
* <a href="/journal/entries.xml" title="Full entries (RSS 2.0)">Journal: Full entries</a>
* <a href="/journal/quicklinks/quicklinks_rss.xml" title="Quicklinks (RSS 2.0)">Quicklinks</a>
* <a href="/journal/comments_atom.xml" title="Most recent comments (RSS 2.0)">Recent comments</a>

h2. What the heck is "a feed"?

Syndication feeds like the ones above are a way to keep up to date with the things posted on a website without having to visit the site every day to check if there is new content.

The newly posted content automagically appears in your feedreader/newsaggregator of choice. If you don't yet have a program for reading feeds or want to know more about feeds, heading to "Lockergnome's RSS Resource(Lockergnome's RSS Resource)":http://rss.lockergnome.com/resources/ should give you a good start.
