Somehow I've managed to be be ignorant to the fact that Quentin Tarantino is finishing up <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0266697" title="IMDB: Kill Bill">a new movie</a>. Judging from <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/miramax/kill_bill/" title="Kill Bill trailer">the trailer</a>, it looks like he'll be going John Woo on Uma Thurmans ass, stepping away from his previous style into a more action-oriented, Matrix/Crouching tiger, Hidden Dragon kind of movie. Personally, I'm looking forward to seeing this, but then again, I am a sucker for swordfights.
