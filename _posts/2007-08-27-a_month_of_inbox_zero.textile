Putting this into the open to force myself to follow through: For the next month, I am going to practice "Inbox Zero":http://inboxzero.com. 

Yes, this is (off course) largely inspired by "Merlin Mann's":http://43folders.com "recent talk at Google":http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=973149761529535925&hl=en, which has caused a fair few ripples around the internet with people realizing the need to keep their inbox clean.

So far, my personal email inbox is clean. I still have to work on my work one, but I believe that to be doable as well.
