There's no denying it anymore, christmas is drawing near. For us danes at least, this means that every single social group you are a part of is going to hold one of the traditional "christmas lunches", where everybody eats and drinks too much.

Friday night I went to one, where the organizers had decided we should have some so-called fun, so we each had to buy and bring 3 cheap presents. At some point after eating we engaged in a lengthy game of dice-rolling that decided who got which presents.

In the end we wound up having bought 3 presents we didn't want to buy and winning a bunch of presents we didn't want to get. At least we looked like enjoying ourselves while trying to win them - all in the good name of tradition.
