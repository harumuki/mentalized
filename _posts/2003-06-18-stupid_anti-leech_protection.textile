I submit to you, the most retarded leech-"protection" script ever: <a title="2 Pinups HQ" href="http://www.fearsquadron.com/2%20Pinups%20HQ.htm">2 Pinups HQ</a>

Dear mr. l337 hax0r webmaster. Your <q>FEAR_SQUADRON ANTI-LEECHING PROTECTION V 2.0</q> does not prevent me from downloading your HTML or images. As a matter of fact, when I am <q>oogling [your pages] at my leasure</q> I have already downloaded all your images. That's the way browsers work, deal with it.

However, your script does prevent me from using my keyboard for scrolling, switching tabs, accessing my menu, accessing my address bar, opening links in a new window, navigating back and forward in my history, bookmarking your site and a multitude of other actions.

Get a grip.
