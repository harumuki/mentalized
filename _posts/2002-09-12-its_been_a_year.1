...now move along. Yesterday was simply too much. Every single newspaper, TV channel and website related to the media felt they had to dwell on the attacks; documentaries of what happened, how sad people are, "experts" trying to guess what will happen in the world etc. Even I created a tacky piece of "In Memoriam"-graphic, which I nearly posted, even though I have no direct relation to any victims of the attack.

Fine, the media has now had their chance to show how compassionate and caring they are. We've had a year to reflect on the "new world". The US has had a chance to enforce their justice. Now we have a chance to wake up and realize that life is moving on.
