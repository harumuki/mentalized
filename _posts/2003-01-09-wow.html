This is pretty cool. Apple recently announced their <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari webbrowser</a>. That's fine and dandy, and I don't use a Mac,so I don't particularly care, but big parts of the blogging community is all over this announcement (quite understandably I might add).

On January 7th, Matthew Haughey wrote on his weblog  <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/archived.blah/01/01/03#1091">about Safari</a>, among other things stating

<blockquote>

My biggest problem with Safari is that it seems to default to a 72dpi display instead of every other modern browser's 96dpi.

</blockquote>

A day later, January 8th, Dave Hyatt who's a developer on Safari, <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/2003_01_05_mozillian_archive.html#90160076">writes on his personal weblog</a>:

<blockquote cite="http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/2003_01_05_mozillian_archive.html#90160076">

we have Safari working at 96dpi now

</blockquote>

Fast reaction, open communication, no bullshitt excuses, way to go! When is Safari due for Windows?
