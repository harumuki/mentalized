2 weeks of (nearly) complete unplugging in sunny Turkey at the coast of the Mediterranean Sea is rejuvenating to say the least. Not having to worry about what the time is or what you are going to do in 5 minutes is a great feeling. One of the evenings while enjoying a good meal and some beers at one of the many local restaurants, my travelmate looked at me and said, "Do you realize we have done absolutely nothing today? Doesn't it feel great?"

But now I am back. 812 emails waiting to be dealt with (damn mailinglists), I am betting a similar number of blog posts, and the regular messageboards are overflowing with posts. Bring 'em on, I'm back, tanned and ready.
