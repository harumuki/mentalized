Ok, I admit it, I am a sucker for gadgets, and especially PDA-style devices seem to be aiming for a soft spot in me. Today <a href="http://www.dell.com/us/en/bsd/products/series_pda_snp.htm">Dell's Axim X5</a> hit me. With a 400Mhz processor, 64MB RAM, expansion for 802.11, space for Flash RAM cards and Audio output it looks very tempting. It doesn't look too bad either.
