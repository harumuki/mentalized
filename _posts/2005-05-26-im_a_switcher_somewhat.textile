This entry is posted from Safari on my sparkling new iBook. Yup, that's right, I am now more or less a switcher - even though I have no plans to discard the Windows PCs just yet.

So far the experience has been nothing but positive. Everything is intuitive - and delicious looking - and even though I've found myself guessing keystrokes or how to do things with the mouse I have generally been able to guess it within a few tries. 

Thumbs up to Apple so far - and thanks to the generous soul who is unknowingly allowing me to post this from the comfort of my couch due to his open WiFi...
