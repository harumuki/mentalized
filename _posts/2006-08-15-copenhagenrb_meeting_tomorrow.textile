Doh, I though I had posted this here already:

Next meeting for the Copenhagen Ruby Brigade is Wednesday 16th (yup, that's tomorrow, I apologize) at 17:00. 

The venue is provided by "Nordija":http://www.nordija.com/ and is located at "NÃ¸rgaardsvej 7, 2800 Kgs. Lyngby":http://www.findvej.dk/n%c3%b8rgaardsvej,2800 - a few minutes walk from Lyngby S-train station.

See you there?
