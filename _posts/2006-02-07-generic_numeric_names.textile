I know "coming up with names is terribly hard":http://mentalized.net/journal/2005/05/09/naming_projects/ - especially if you want a domain name that goes with it. But c'mon, the numbers thing was cute when only a few had it, now it's just overdone. The old timers include "9 Rules":http://9rules.com, "37signals":http://37signals.com, "43 Things":http://43things.com", and now we get "30 Boxes":http://30boxes.com from "83 degrees":http://83degrees.com, gah! 

At least "23":http://23hq.com embraced the consequence and just called themselves a number and nothing else.
