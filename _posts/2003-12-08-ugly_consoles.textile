Recently some supposedly "concept images of the PlayStation 3(gamesindustry.biz: PS3 'concept image' hits the web)":http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?section_name=dev&aid=2639 circulated on the gaming websites. Hopefully they are the real deal, since they look pretty neat, which brings up another thought; Why the heck are all video game systems so ugly (or at least boring)?

Consider the existing systems - none of those are exactly objects of beauty that you can proudly to display prominently on the entertainment altar in your living room, are they?

Have Sony seen the light and is trying to turn video games systems into something that people can place under the "Beovision(Bang & Olufsen)":http://www.bang-olufsen.com/sw172.asp Plasma TV and still remain hip?
