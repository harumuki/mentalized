Not only the <a href="/journal/archives/000033.asp">danish newspaper industry aspires to become the next extinct dinosaur</a> in the digital world of tomorrow. The music business is right on their tail. <a href="http://www.emi-medley.dk/">EMI</a> has <a href="http://www.computerworld.dk/default.asp?Mode=2&ArticleID=16637">announced</a> that they have found the solution to their dwindling income: They will simply use copy-protection on their CDs - that should take care of digitally pirated music...

I am terribly sorry, but I fail to see why EMI believe they are different from the software business, where decades of copy-protection have not got rid of the software <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=software+pirates">pirates</a>. I also fail to see how this will solve the problem with the distribution of MP3's which until now have been blamed for the decline in revenues. And lastly I fail to see how they can be so naive to think that a copy-protection will <a href="http://www.pcwelt.de/ratgeber/hardware/17678/6.html">actually work</a> - if it can be read digitally, it can be copied digitally. 

Think again, EMI - or is it simply "think"?
