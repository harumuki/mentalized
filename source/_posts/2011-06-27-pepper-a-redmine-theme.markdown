You develop great software. You use [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org) to manage your projects. Your Redmine instance should look at least as high tech and sleek as the software you develop.

That can now be fixed, using my newly released theme, [Pepper](https://github.com/koppen/redmine-pepper-theme).

I use [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org) for managing all of [my client projects](http://substancelab.com/work). For the longest time I have used a home-made theme resembling the look and feel of my <a href="http://substancelab.com" title="Freelance Ruby on Rails development agency">company website</a>.

That never really was optimal so I wanted something better. While there are many fine [Redmine themes](http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Theme_List) out there, I didn't really feel any of them looked like I'd like them to.

So I designed and built my own and I'm releasing it for the greater good.


## Pepper - a Redmine theme

Pepper is a Redmine theme that looks professional, generic enough to be usable by most organizations, while not becoming bland or boring - fitting for any high tech software company.

It has been tested with [Redmine](http://redmine.org) 1.2, and should work fine with [Chili Project](http://chiliproject.org) as well.

[Grab it over at the Githubs](https://github.com/koppen/redmine-pepper-theme) and read the full README there as well.


## Features

* Fluid width design
* Responsive design that adapts to small screens
* Project selector moved to top menu
* Copious amounts of CSS3 to achieve almost image-less styling


## Browsers

While Pepper has been designed for modern browsers, thus looks its best in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, it looks fine in IE9 and degrades gracefully for other less capable browsers.


Here's hoping you like and use it, I'd love to hear your feedback.
