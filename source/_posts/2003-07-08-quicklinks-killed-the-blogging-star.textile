I am not sure creating a quicklinks sidebar was such a great idea for me after all. These days, whenever I see something on the Web that I find interesting and worth a comment, I mindlessly add it to my quicklinks. Why? Because it's quick, it's easy, and I don't have to disengage my brains hibernation mode.

A few quicklinks every other day and I consider my blog updated. I don't even have to do anything but press a few keys for it to work, although if I am hyperactive from too much coffee I might add a profound comment like "Wow" or "OMFG" to cover my needs for expressing myself creatively.

What a poor excuse for content, huh?
