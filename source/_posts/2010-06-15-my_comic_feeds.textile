I was asked on Twitter what feeds I have in my Comics/Humor category in my feed reader. Since 140 characters isn't enough, the list goes here instead:


<!--more-->

* "The Brads":http://bradcolbow.com/
* "Ctrl+Alt+Del":http://cad-comic.com/
* "Dilbert":http://dilbert.com
* "The noob":http://thenoobcomic.com/
* "Penny Arcade":http://penny-arcade.com/comic/
* "PvPonline":http://pvponline.com
* "Savage Chickens":http://savagechickens.com/
* "wulffmorgenthaler":http://wulffmorgenthaler.com/
* "xkcd":http://xkcd.com

If you sense a slight geek/gamer direction in those, you would be correct.
