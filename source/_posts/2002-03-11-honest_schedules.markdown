I admit, I have commited one of the death-sins of project development. I let myself to believe, that a tight schedule and increased working hours would enable me to fulfill the deadline my boss had set for a project.

As a result I am now grossly overdue, I am feeling ever more demotivated and I am constantly walking around with a gnawing feeling in my stomach telling me that I am too stressed and that I haven't been doing my job well enough.

Trust me on this one, don't fool yourself: Make an honest schedule, the alternative simply isn't worth it.
