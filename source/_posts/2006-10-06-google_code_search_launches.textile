"Google Code Search":http://www.google.com/codesearch is a new search on  Google Labs specifically for searching through, well, source code.

And what do the geeks do with it? 

* "Figure out how many fucks are in the code of various languages":http://blog.predius.org/2006/10/05/fucks-per-source-package-and-license/
* "Find serial number generation algorithms":http://businesslogs.com/web_20/google_code_search_is_live_find_serial_number_generation_algorithms.php
* "Locate WordPress login information":http://www.google.com/codesearch?as_q=username&btnG=Search+Code&as_lang=&as_license_restrict=i&as_license=&as_package=&as_filename=wp-config.php&as_case=

Awesome. I am sure there must be some legitimate uses for the search, though, and it'll be interesting to see what creative geeks will create with it.
