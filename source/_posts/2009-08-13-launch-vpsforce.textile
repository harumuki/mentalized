"Fab:IT":http://www.fab-it.dk, a small hosting company in Copenhagen, Denmark, has long been my standard go-to-guys when I need a VPS hosted locally. They wanted to put more focus on their VPS hosting products, and asked me to build them a dedicated site for their offerings.

I teamed up with Kasper from "activeart":http://activeart.dk and aided by "Laust Rud Jacobsen":http://www.linkedin.com/pub/laust-rud-jacobsen/1/7b2/919 and built them the simple almost-one-page-website you can see at "http://vpsforce.eu":http://vpsforce.eu.
