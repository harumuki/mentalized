Danish television is currently airing a "Gears of World ad":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccWrbGEFgI8&mode=related&search= featuring war torn buildings, full automatic assault rifles, and galactic mega spider monsters, all to the sound of "Mad World".

I didn't really know the song before I heard it in the Gears of War ad, so I went to the iTunes Store to see if I could locate it. Lo and behold, there it was, as the top song on the danish iTunes Store: "Mad World (from Donnie Darko)".

Seems like advertising does work. Heck, I'd even like to have the game as well (oh yeah, and the XBox 360 that goes with it).
