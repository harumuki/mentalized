One thing that usability "guru", Jakob Nielsen, is often bashed for is "his website, useit.com (useit.com)":http://www.useit.com, which is, hmm, less aesthetically pleasing than it could be. And by that, I mean it's ugly.

Now, Bob from "Built For The Future (Built for the future)":http://www.builtforthefuture.com/ has launched a "competition to redesign Jakob Nielsens website (ReUSEIT)":http://www.builtforthefuture.com/reuseit/. The competition even has prizes (omg) and is endorsed by mr. Nielsen himself. Sadly, or naturally, he won't promise that he will use any of the entries.

It's going to be interesting to see what the frothing community of webdesigners will come up with when given the challenge of redesigning an actual live website. Heck, if I can find the time, I might even give it a shot myself but we'll see about that.
