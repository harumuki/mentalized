My recent addiction of <a href="http://www.neversoft.com/th3/index.htm">Tony Hawks Pro Skating 3</a> has made my current playlist take a step back in time - approximatly 10 years, leaving me at a time of my life where I wore a cap backwards and thought I was fly. Artists like Run DMC (trying to steer clear of the Jason Nevin remixes), Methodman, Del The Funky Homosapien, McEjnar, Ozomati, Krs-1 and Xzibit currently grace my playlist.
