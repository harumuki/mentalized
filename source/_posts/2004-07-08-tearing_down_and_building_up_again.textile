For a long time I have been contemplating redesigning this website. Not because it really needed it (I actually quite liked the old look), however I had to redesign _something_. So I did.

There are still a few quirks to iron out, obviously, including making IE render the site as I want it to. I might get around to that eventually.

Anyways, enjoy, and let me know if something has turned out to be crap.
