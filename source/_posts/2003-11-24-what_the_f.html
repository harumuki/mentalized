<blockquote cite="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=fuck">
<p>fuck; [Middle English, attested in pseudo-Latin fuccant, (they) fuck, deciphered from gxddbov.]</p>

<p>Word History: The obscenity fuck is a very old word and has been considered shocking from the first, though it is seen in print much more often now than in the past. Its first known occurrence, in code because of its unacceptability, is in a poem composed in a mixture of Latin and English sometime before 1500. [...] The line that contains fuck reads "Non sunt in coeli, quia gxddbov xxkxzt pg ifmk." The Latin words "Non sunt in coeli, quia," mean "they [the friars] are not in heaven, since." The code "gxddbov xxkxzt pg ifmk" is easily broken [...]. This yields "fvccant [a fake Latin form] vvivys of heli." The whole thus reads in translation: "They are not in heaven because they fuck wives of Ely [a town near Cambridge]."</p>

And here I thought the word was reasonably new,  live and learn.
