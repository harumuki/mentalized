Saturday was my birthday. 27 years ago I entered the world with a hair-do much like the one I have been sporting the last few years.

It is sort of funny how little my birthday means to me nowadays. I think I would have forgotten about it if my mother hadn't invited me home to celebrate the day with half the family. It was quite a nice day, seeing some of the loved familymembers I so rarely get to see, while eating way too much of mama's meals.

Oddly enough, I don't feel much older today even though I am an entire year older today than I was before the weekend started. Perhaps I won't start noticing until I turn 30, who knows.
