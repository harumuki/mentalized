Hm, somebody from 134.84.144.* have started requesting my index-page using "slashdot.org" as referrer. Needless to say that referrer is a straight lie as I have never been linked on the frontpage of <a href="http://slashdot.org" title="/.">slashdot</a>, neither does the page http://mentalized.net/slashdot.org exist (which is what that referrer actually means).

It doesn't appear to be a spider from slashdot either as slashdot exists at 66.35.250.150, not 134.84.144.*. Welcome to my blacklist.
