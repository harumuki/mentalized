While checking out "Scott Baron":http://lunchroom.lunchboxsoftware.com/'s coverage-tool for Ruby, "insurance":http://rubyforge.org/projects/insurance/, I ran into a minor issue on my - by now - fairly beat up Debian installation.

{% highlight console %}
jcop@mental:~$ sudo gem install insurance
Attempting local installation of 'insurance'
Local gem file not found: insurance*.gem
Attempting remote installation of 'insurance'
Updating Gem source index for: http://gems.rubyforge.org
Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
extconf.rb:1:in `require': no such file to load -- mkmf (LoadError)
        from extconf.rb:1
{% endhighlight %}

Thankfully, Google led me to "the answer on RubyForge":http://rubyforge.org/forum/forum.php?thread_id=4161&forum_id=4050. For some reason, mkmf.rb is part of the ruby1.8-dev package, and initially I hadn't installed that since it is described as

bq. Header files for compiling extension modules for the Ruby 1.8

Ah well. A quick

{% highlight console %}
sudo apt-get install ruby1.8-dev
{% endhighlight %}

and everything trotted along happily after that.
