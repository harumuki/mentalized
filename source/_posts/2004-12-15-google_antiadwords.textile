This showed up in my Google ads today:

!/journal/2004/12/15/google_antiadwords/jensjacobberlin.png(Jens Jacob, Berlin)!

Apparently someone really has it in for Jens Jacob, Berlin and is willing to spend money on getting his point through.

This made me wonder what other, creative, non-advertising uses people have found for "Google AdWords(Google AdWords)":https://adwords.google.com/select/main?cmd=Login&sourceid=mktadv&subid=adwords&hl=en_US. Locating lost dogs? Finding a date for the weekend? Proposing perhaps?
