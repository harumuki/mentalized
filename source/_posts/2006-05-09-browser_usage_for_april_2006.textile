h2. mentalized.net

Things are looking great for Firefox - at least on this page:

!http://mentalized.net/files/journal/statistics/browsers_april2006(mentalized.net browser statistics for April 2006)!

h2. BiQ.dk

!http://mentalized.net/files/journal/statistics/biq_browsers_april2006(biq.dk browser statistics for April 2006)!

It looks a lot worse on a business-to-business website like "BiQ":http://www.biq.dk, unfortunately. Such a shame.
