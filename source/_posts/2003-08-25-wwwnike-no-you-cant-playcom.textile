Gee, my browser is a nightly build from August 20th 2003 - less than a week ago. Internet Explorer is from, what, 2001? And they have the nerve to claim that my browser is "outdated"?

Alright, so Nike can't figure out to build standards compliant websites <em>or</em> sniff browsers properly. Fine, at least they provide a "continue without upgrading" link - which takes me to Nike Freestyle, not Nike Play.

Nike, I guess I didn't want to visit your website anyways ::close tab::
