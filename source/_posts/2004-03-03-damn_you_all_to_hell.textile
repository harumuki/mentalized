People, stop getting viruses - how hard can it be? Having a virus scanner is no reason to not apply common sense when reading emails. Failing to do so results in me having to deal with people assuming that since *your* virus forged *my* email address as sender, that I am the one stupid enough to have been infected.

Sigh...
