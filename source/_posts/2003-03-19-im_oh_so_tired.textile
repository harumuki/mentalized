...and I'm blaming Splinter Cell. I recently installed the game and it has sucked me in. Quite odd, as I never found the demo particulary interesting, but the full game has managed to get me to the point where "I'll just finish this mission before going to bed" and end up going to bed at 3AM after 2 more missions have been finished. Great game.
