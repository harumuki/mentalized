How the ... do people come up with names for companies and projects. I don't get it. It seems that I can come up with a name in two ways:

# Grab the first that comes into my mind and go with that even though it blows. "Notetagger":http://mentalized.net/journal/2005/04/15/notetagger_the_introduction/ ?! Cmon, Jakob, surely you can do better...
# Spend forever pondering synonyms, combinations, puns, making endless lists and evaluating, scrapping, thinking, reconsidering, and eventually end up deciding that I can't come up with a name that works. Gah!

To top it all off, I've found a criteria that's perfect for figuring out if the name I've come up with is good enough: The domain name is taken. For all worthwhile top level domains.

Sigh.
