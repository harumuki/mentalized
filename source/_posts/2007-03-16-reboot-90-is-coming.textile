At the end of May 2007 the next iteration of "the conference for practical visionaries":http://reboot.dk opens it doors. Pre-registration including an earl-bird discount is available, and the program is being suggested and formed by potential participant on "the absolutely terrible website":http://reboot.dk.

I am kind of undecided wether I'll be attending. "Last year didn't really do it for me":https://mentalized.net/journal/2006/06/06/reboot-reflections/, but "the year before was just great":https://mentalized.net/journal/2005/06/12/reboot7-afterthoughts/. It's also a great of hooking up with people I merely know by their blog URLs.

Hm, I'll probably end up going if I can persuade my boss to fork over the registration fee.
