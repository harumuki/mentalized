I have been a bad blogger - No updates from me in ages, and just as the <a  href="http://www.mentalized.net/journal/archives/000035.asp">masses of readers started pouring in</a>. ;) The reason for this is simply that I haven't had the energy lately to write anything, not even something partly intelligent. My work has sucked me dry, but luckily there is hope in the future.

My vacation is hastily approaching - the first longer vacation for me in 2 years, and I am so looking forward to it. My dear parents have invited me on a 4 week trip to USA, California primarily, starting next month - 4 weeks of seeing new sights, meeting new people and not thinking about deadlines, schedules, testcases, search-algorithms and whatnot, aaaaaaah... wish we were leaving tomorrow.
