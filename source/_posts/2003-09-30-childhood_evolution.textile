When I was a kid, one of the things we occasionally did was play Convenient Store. We'd take a bunch of old boxes and empty jars and line them up on a desk with a teller. One would then be the owner and the rest would come buy from him with monopoly money and if we got bored we'd rob the store.

When we grew a bit older and started caring about money, we'd setup a garage sale with old junk found in the attic, selling our parents precious items for a lollypop and 2 pieces of string.

Nowadays "kids sell popcorn(Kiddie Commerce :: Kalsey Consulting Group)":http://kalsey.com/2003/09/kiddie_commerce/  in an "online store(Cub Scout Popcorn)":http://popcorn.kalsey.com/ accepting payment through PayPal.

That's evolution for you.
