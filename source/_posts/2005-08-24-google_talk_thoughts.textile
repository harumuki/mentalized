"Jabber-based, Google-sponsored Instant Messaging":http://www.google.com/talk/. Bloody hell, don't I feel silly now for never getting my kickass Jabber client application running. Oh, and "hah" to all of you thought I was crazy when talking about the benefits of Jabber ;)

Could it be the first Jabber client with voice support? Wonder how Skype feels about Google stepping in on their turf.

Update: It seems they feel the need to say "Skype opens IM and Presence to the world. Introducing SkypeWeb and SkypeNet":http://share.skype.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=162&Itemid=69.
