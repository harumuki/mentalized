<ins>J-ReferrerTracker is no more, I'm sorry. And if you're still using ASP/VBscript, I'm very sorry</ins>

For some time now, I have been using <a href="http://www.downes.ca/referrers.htm">Steven's JavaScript</a> to track referrers to my site. This wasn't exactly what I wanted as it didn't give me an overview over what pages actually got linked, so I decided to create my own tracker in ASP/VBscript (ugh) - thus J-ReferrerTracker was born.

It isn't fancy at all, but it gets the job done in a manner I am happy with. I've released it to the general public in case others might get happy as well.
