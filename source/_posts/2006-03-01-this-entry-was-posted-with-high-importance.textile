I loathe the "High importance" flag in Outlook. I especially loathe that the sender can set it: "My email is much, much more important than whatever other puny stuff you've received". How arrogant is that?

"This message was sent with High Importance". Oh really? Guess what, I couldn't care less. I prioritize my email and tasks myself, thank you very much.

Oh, and you, miss "I am so important the world collapses if I don't get access to your site right now", just got flagged low importance.
