I hate rain. Not the rain itself, but the fact that when it rains, everybody gets out their umbrellas the size of circus tents. It makes it impossible for me to move around on the sidewalks without getting my eyes poked out. Damn rain.

I love rain. Not the rain itself, but that freshness in the air after a good shower. Taking a walk after it has rained is a rejuvenating experience, you can practically smell the city having been cleaned. If I could bottle that freshness I'd make a fortune.
