Combine a scooter with inline skates and a pair of skis, and you get <a title="Trikke" href="http://www.trikke.com/index.php">Trikke</a> with the added bonus of looking ridiculous while riding it (or rock'n'rolling in Trikke-lingo).

Looking at their <a href="http://www.trikke.com/vids_017b.php">tricks video</a> it can even do outrageous tricks like turning, going down a hill and lifting the rear wheels one at a time!
