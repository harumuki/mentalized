Sigh, the year 2003 sure starts interesting. One of the developers we have used in building an important tool for <a href="http://www.biq.dk" title="BiQ (in danish)">our website</a> apparently didn't have enough confidence to believe that his work would be used for more than half a year.

At leasn't he didn't bother to create a date-recognizing algorithm that accepted years after 2002 as proper dates, so when my boss tried running the tool on his first day at work in the new year, it broke. 1 minute later I get torn out of my warm, cozy bed about an hour before planned and had to go through his crappy code to fix his thoughtless bug before I even got my first cup of coffee. Not surprisingly, the regex "<code>19\d\d|200[012]</code>" does not cover all possible years.

Gee, a year 2003 bug, and it's all mine, I'm so pleased.
