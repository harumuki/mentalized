I totally forgot to mention this when it actually went live a few weeks back. At "BÃ¸rn i byen":http://bornibyen.dk we've been busy redesigning and changing things around, and the result is now live at "bornibyen.dk":http://bornibyen.dk

h2. New look and feel

I can't claim credit for the actual design itself, though, I only chopped it into clean markup and implemented it in the application. The design was made modern and spiffy by "11design":http://11design.dk/ and the information architecture was hammered into place by Ingrid Haug from "Usable Machine":http://usablemachine.com/.

We are still cleaning up the corners of the site, removing remnants of the old site design, which - to be honest - I am pleased to see go. It served us well, but looks real dated by now.
