For some reason I've been invited to contribute to a newly launched Danish Mac user blog, "cupertino.dk":http://cupertino.dk. Due to my Mac-noobness I've been watching from the safety of far away as "bundles of energetic and enthusiastic people":http://cupertino.dk/theteam/ got stuff up and running.

I'm very much looking forward to try blogging in Danish for a change. By far most of my writing (here, at work, everywhere) is in English even though it is a secondary language to me.

If you're into Macs and understand danish or like guessing, head on over, subscribe to the feed, tell us what you want to hear, and generally consume it.
