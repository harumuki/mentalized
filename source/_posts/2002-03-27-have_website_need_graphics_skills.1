Recently I have found myself spending more and more time on <a href="http://www.pixelcore.com">various graphics/design-sites</a> going over their tutorials, desperatly trying to mimick their looks, feels and styles. I've followed tutorial after tutorial, studied one wallpaper after the other and I still can't get things to look the way I want them to. 

Dammit! This site really needs a graphical overhaul - I am far from contend with the current looks.
