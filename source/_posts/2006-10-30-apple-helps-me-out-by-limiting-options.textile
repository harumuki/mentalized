Looks like "Apples":http://www.apple.com recent upgrade of the "MacBook Pro line":http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/ helped answer "the questions I had in regards to buying a MBP":http://mentalized.net/journal/2006/10/12/seeking-mac-shopping-advice/ :

* The 7200 RPM drive is no longer an option.
* MacBook Pro now ships with a minimum of 2GB RAM (which kinda sucks, since there was a fair amount of cash to save here).

Now, the purchase is pretty much a no-brainer, and a 2.33GHz 15" MBP should be heading my way the coming weeks.

Huge thanks to all those who took the time advising me about what options to get.
