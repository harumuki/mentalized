<p>So to recap, I take a photo with my phone, push about 7 buttons to send it off to a secret email account on one server. A cronjob on a different server checks the account every 10 minutes, then processes the messages and sends the results to a third server via xml-prc, which updates a movable type blog (including one custom template to produce the table you see above, and another template to create the CSS on the fly), which is included in another movable type blog</p>

<p>I know, I'm a geek, but <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/archives.blah/006737" title="A Whole Lotta Nothing: Moblogging with M T, pop2blog and my phone">that</a>'s seriously cool; "instant" photoblogging from ones camera telephone. Better living through Linux, XML-RPC and open source? ;)</p>
