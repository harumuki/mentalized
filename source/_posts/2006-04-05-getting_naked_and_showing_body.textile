Some days ago Dustin Diaz proposed April 5th as the "first annual CSS naked day":http://naked.dustindiaz.com/. Basically in an effort to promote semantically correct markup that renders properly even without stylesheets, we should all strip off our styles and show the naked markup. 

I've done just that, so behold mentalized in all it's unstyled glory. I'm not too bad off, if I may say so myself.
