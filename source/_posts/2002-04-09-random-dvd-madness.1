Owning a DVD-player is ruining me. While <a href="http://www.dvdoo.com/dvdoo/film.asp?Command=7554">preordering my DVD copy</a> of <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0120737">Lord of the Rings - Fellowship of the Rings</a> (that movie is <em>so</em> amazing), <a href="http://www.dvdoo.dk">the DVD vendor</a> managed to tempt me into visiting their area with <a href="http://www.dvdoo.com/dvdoo/tilbud.asp">special offers</a>. Bad idea! Before I had managed to think twice about this, I had spent 520 DKR and bought 5 DVDs (of which <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0080455">Blues Brothers</a> and <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0119116">The Fifth Element</a> arrived earlier today). This was in addition to the 300 DKR I spent on the LotR-movie. Hmm, I also need a bigger TV-set and some surround-gear...
