Thank you for taking the time to contact us.

As you may be aware, Internet Explorer on Windows has had support for PNG images since version 4.  A drawback in the current implementation has been support for per-pixel alpha values, which in no way detracts from PNG's value as an alternative to other image formats.  Based on feedback such as yours, we have provided a workaround for this issue.

Once again, thanks for providing feedback on Internet Explorer.
