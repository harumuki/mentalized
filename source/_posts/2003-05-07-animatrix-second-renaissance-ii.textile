It's May and it's time for the final free <a href="http://www.theanimatrix" title="The Animatrix">Animatrix</a> episode before <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0234215" title="IMDb: Matrix Reloaded">The Big Bang</a>: <a title="Animatrix: The Second Renaissance Part II" href="http://www.intothematrix.com/rl_cmp/anime_frames_sr2.html">The Second Renaissance Part II</a>.

The 10 minute movie is a dark and grim depiction of the events that lead to the fall of flesh prior to the events in the first Matrix movie.

We are told the tale of mankinds final desperate battle against the machine army, the torching of the sky, and the treaty signed by man and machine that lead to the building of the first matrix. Very good stuff.
