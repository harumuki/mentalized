I've been digg'd (or is that dugg)?

Looks like my 4 month old "tutorial"/satire, "how to build your own Web2.0 layout":http://mentalized.net/journal/2005/10/10/building_your_very_own_web20_layout/ has reached the masses of "digg":http://digg.com for some reason.

This is what "945 diggs":http://digg.com/design/How_to_build_your_own_Web_2.0_layout can do to your meager stats:
