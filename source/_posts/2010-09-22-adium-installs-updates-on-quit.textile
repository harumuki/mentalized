Adium has moved one step closer to the approach "I've suggested":https://mentalized.net/journal/2010/01/08/the-tyranny-of-software-updates/ applications take for software updates:

"Install on Quit" is a great option and sure beats the "install now and interrupt what I wanted to do". I would prefer that the upgrade dialog only popped up when I quit the application, but I'll take any incremental improvement.
