I recently had the pleasure of experiencing <a title="MOBY.COM" href="http://www.moby.com/index2.html">Moby's</a> newest music video in its full length. The tune is as always from Moby spacey and nicely chilling, and the video itself is a blast.

I love those <a href="http://www.moby.com/images/splash1-2.jpg">tiny aliens</a> and their <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=perseverence">perseverence</a>. I even think they might be on to something; sometimes all you need is a bigger sign.
