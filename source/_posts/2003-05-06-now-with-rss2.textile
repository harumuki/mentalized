My <a href="/journal/2003/05/05/i-wonder-what-all-the-rss-fuss-is-about/">recent endavours</a> into the world of RSS aggregators and feeds pointed out to me, that an RSS2.0 feed was AGoodThing. <a href="/journal/entries.xml" title="RSS2.0 feed with the last 10 journal entries">So be it</a>.

My <a href="/journal/entries.xml" title="RSS0.91 feed with the last 10 journal entries">RSS0.91 feed</a> is still around and will be updated in case anyone needs it to be for some reason.
