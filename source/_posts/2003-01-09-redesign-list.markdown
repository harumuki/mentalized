Brad Choate is redesigning <a href="http://www.bradchoate.com/">his website</a>, and he's <a title="Brads Reboot-entry" href="http://www.bradchoate.com/past/reboot2003.php">blogging his progress</a>. He has a long list of ideas/task indicating a good deal of care for usability/technical details and is checking them off as he goes.

In a voyeuristic kind of way, it is interesting to watch how somebody else deals with a redesign process, and with minor tweaking his list can be used as a general (albeit not complete) checklist for most (re)design tasks out there.
