"Can I touch it?"

"Uhm, huh?", the guy in front of me replied as intelligently as he could.

"Can I touch it?" I repeated my question, elaborating; "I just want to feel how it is"

He looked at me with eyes that clearly said, "Dude, you're weird", but he kept his cool and his mouth said "err, okay, I guess", and he led me to the back of the room.

One should think he never before had a customer actually want to try out a new keyboard prior to buying it.
