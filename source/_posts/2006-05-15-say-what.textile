Small plea to podcasters; Crank up the volume, we old geezers can't hear your (probably) quality content.

I'm getting close to 30 years old and apparently my hearing is already failing. Even if I crank the volume on my iPod up to max it's near impossible to hear what's being said on the podcasts I follow. Unless ofcourse I'm located in a totally quiet room, which is far from my common listening environment.

"TWiT":http://thisweekintech.com/ gets audio quality and volume right. The podcasts published by the "danish public radio":http://www.dr.dk do as well.

I'm close to giving up on podcasts. I frankly don't see the point of subscribing when I can't hear what's being said and I really want to be cool and down with the young podcast-listening whippersnappers.
