The following reached me through "my old EverQuest guilds messageboard":http://www.povartarewalliance.org from someone on the outskirts of the Katrina disaster zone:

<blockquote>
<ul>
    <li>People are dying in N.O. due to lack of medical supplies.</li>
    <li>Hospitals in N.O. are working without power or water moving patients up one story at a time.</li>
    <li>Sharks have been spotted swimming in the streets</li>
    <li>Out lying parishes are allowing people to register thier children for the local schools</li>
    <li>Jefferson parish is going to allow people with ID to go home and collect what they can on Monday, but then they must leave for at least 1 month.</li>
    <li>Orleans parish will not be allowed to even do that.</li>
    <li>30% of the US oil production was impacted</li>
    <li>Major refineries have been shutdown</li>
    <li>Current expectation is that water levels in N.O. will be 3 ft more than the Gulf.</li>
    <li>Prisoner have taken hostages</li>
    <li>Police have been shot attempting to control looting</li>
    <li>Looters are taking firearms and firing on police stations</li>
    <li>Gas lines are ruptured and there are burning fountains bubbling up out of the water</li>
    <li>
        The body count has not even started
        <ul>
            <li>Doomsday estimates from worst case were 20-30 thousand.</li>
            <li>Unofficially they expect this to be more than 9/11...hopefully no where near the above.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>People are jumping from the top sections of the Superdome in despair</li>

    <li>Major interstate bridges were destroyed</li>
    <li>How are the displaced people going to pay bills or even recieve them?</li>
    <li>In Iraq and Indonesia, no matter how bad those were, communications still existed...not here.</li>
    <li>People are calling on cell phones to media outlets begging for rescue.</li>
    <li>Phone communications is spotty at best...911 is out.</li>
    <li>Cell phone towers are running out of battery power</li>
    <li>Officials estimate that N.O. will take 6 weeks just to finish rescue and repair levees.</li>
    <li>It is unknown how long to drain.</li>
    <li>Private individuals are being asked to bring boats and volunteer to help rescue.</li>
    <li>People are dying in shelters because they have no medicine or prescription information to get items refilled.  </li>
    <li>Parents have just lost everything they ever worked for.</li>
    <li>Children are sleeping on concrete. </li>
</ul>
