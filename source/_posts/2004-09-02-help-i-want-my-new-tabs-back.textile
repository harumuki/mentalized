At some point my Firefox 0.9 stopped opening links in a new tab in an existing window and instead opens them in an entirely new window. I don't recall exactly when this happened, but it has been a while now. I am getting pretty tired of my "taskbar looking like this(28(!) Firefox windows)":/files/journal/help_i_want_my_new_tabs_back/28firefox.png after having gone over my feed subscriptions in FeedDemon every morning. I have no idea how to fix this, help!
