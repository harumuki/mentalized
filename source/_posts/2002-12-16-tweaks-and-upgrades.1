During the weekend I've been going through the site, tweaking CSS, HTML and Javascripts in order to become 100% standards compliant and to fix some visual quirks. After struggling with Movable Type templates, their standard scripts, the lack of <a href="http://www.mentalized.net/journal/archives/000091.asp">CSS2 support</a> in IE, and other minor details (like the fact that IE actually renders &lt;form&gt;-elements), it looks like I have reached my goal.

All pages should now <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mentalized.net">validate as XHTML 1.0 Strict</a> and my stylesheet <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mentalized.net%2Fincludes%2Fstyle%2Fv2.css&amp;warning=1&amp;profile=css2">validates as CSS2</a>. If you happen to find one that doesn't, <a href="http://www.mentalized.net/journal/archives/000092.asp#postcomment">let me know</a>.
