Creating website designs is fun. So I did it again. Welcome to yet another look of Mentalized. This time the change of look also features some changes under the hood, so except things to break until I get everything worked out.

Hm, let's see, what have I changed apart from the look - I probably should've kept a changelog ;)

* First of all, the entire site now runs from Movable Type - "details here(Power your website with Movable Type)":https://mentalized.net/features/movable_type/power_your_website_with_movable_type/ .
* Metatags on my various index pages should prevent search engines from returning the index pages as results, instead returning the actual archived entries.
* Search for the entire site
* Moved some pages to other locations, old URLs should still work
* Employed "my idea(scrap those pixels)":https://mentalized.net/journal/2003/08/08/scrap-those-pixels/ for using em's for all widths, creating a fixed-width website that scales with the users preferred font-size.

So far the site has been tested and looks acceptable in Firebird, Safari, Internet Explorer (Win), Camino - all of which I believe are newest available versions. If you still come across something that has gone bonkers, please let me know, and remember to include your browsername and version, thanks.
