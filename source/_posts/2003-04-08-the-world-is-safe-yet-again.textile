Ah, got Splinter Cell beat finally - at the expense of last nights sleep. But when the world is threatened by international terrorist conspiracies, things like ones beauty sleep have to be prioritized down, right?

The last mission of the game is great (as is the entire game). It's a long mission where you really get to use your hitech ninja skills, plenty of tight situations where you need impecable timing to make it undetected past the guard, and some tense actionfilled moments.

I have a feeling I'll be going back the next few days and retry some of the earlier missions, just to see if I can avoid detection in this and that spot.
