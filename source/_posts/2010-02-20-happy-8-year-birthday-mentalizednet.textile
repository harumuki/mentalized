8 years ago, I posted "this":http://mentalized.net/journal/2002/02/20/this-is-a-weblog/ to mentalized.net:

<blockquote><p>I have always promised myself that I would not fall prey to the blogging-fever that has been going around, and for a long time the title of my website actually was "This is not a weblog"...</p>

<p>Well, nothing lasts forever - neither did my opinion on weblogs. Welcome to my journal.</p></blockquote>

8 years later, I am still going strong (albeit not as strong as 4 years ago) who'd have thunk?

h2. Holy time machine, blogman

Back then, mentalized.net looked like this:

So very, very blog-like :)
