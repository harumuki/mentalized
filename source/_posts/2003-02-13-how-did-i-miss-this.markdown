The first installment of <a href="http://www.theanimatrix.com" title="What is the Animatrix">the Animatrix</a> has been released. 9 minutes of animation documenting the initial, small uprise of the machines. Seems like 3 more parts will be released each month until <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0234215" title="Matrix Reloaded on IDMb">Matrix Reloaded</a> hits the cinemas. Enough of my gibberish, view <a href="http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/index_anime.html">The Second Renassaince - part 1</a>.
