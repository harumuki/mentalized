Over the last month I have turned on my Windows PC a minimal amount of times. And every time it has been for one of three reasons:

* Playing World of Warcraft
* Listening to music
* The Girl is using the iBook

Last I checked, Mac OS X was able to handle all of the above scenarios just fine. Can it really be that I no longer have a reason to own a Windows PC for personal use?

"The company":http://substancelab.com obviously needs to be able to check websites in IE still, so I won't get rid of the PC, but I'm finding it hard to come up with an argument for upgrading it instead of buying a new Mac. Hmm...
