Aaah! During the last 1½ week I've kicked back, enjoyed good food and cold beer in sunny Budapest with "great friends":http://www.povartarewalliance.org/album/album.shtml?action=showImage&album=Orum&page=album&image=30 and - ofcourse - the Girl, followed by a weekend of more sun, more beers, more friends and "good music":http://www.jellingmusikfestival.dk back in Denmark.

Alas, Monday has now kicked in, reality has returned, and I've finally gotten through 1½ hours email backlog. Now it's time to work through the last weeks happenings in the blogosphere or whatever the word for it is these days.

"FeedDemon":http://www.bradsoft.com/feeddemon is overflowing with unread entries so expect bundles of "Quicklinks":http://mentalized.net/journal/quicklinks/ today.
