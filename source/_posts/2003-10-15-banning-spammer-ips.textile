Jason from "izzy|wizzy(izzy|wizzy)":http://izzywizzy.org has extended my Movable Type "Edit Comment hack(Easier edit/removal of new comments)":/journal/2003/09/09/movable-type-easier-editremoval-of-new-comments/ so the notification mail now contains a <a title="izzy|wizzy : Ban Those Spam Comment IPs" href="http://izzywizzy.org/blah.old/2003/10/ban_those_spam_comment_ips.php">Ban This Spam Comment IP</a> link. Great job.

In related news, Jay Allen has released his "MT-Blacklist plugin( MT-Blacklist: Stop Spam Now)":http://www.jayallen.org/journey/2003/10/mtblacklist_stop_spam_now - the plugin to end all spam ;)
