When Disney and Jerry Bruckheimer are among the names behind a movie, you are almost guaranteed 2 hours filled with action, fun and adventures. "Pirates of the Carribean(IMDb: Pirates of the Carribean (2003))":http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325980/ fully lives up to this guarantee. 

The swordfights and jokes are swift and plenty, the explosions and sea-battles are impressive, and Johnny Depp is great as the fallen pirate, Jack Sparrow. 

Pirates of the Carribean is a popcorn-flick and has no intention of being otherwise. It delivers the story and punchlines with a wink and entertains for a full 2 hours.
