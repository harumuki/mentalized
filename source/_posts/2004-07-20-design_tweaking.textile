Messed around with the new layout a bit today, fixing some issues and likely creating some new ones:

* The sidebar has been given a background color to seperate it a bit more from the main content.
* The main navigation links has been spaced out and given a hover style to make them more visible.
* The dropshadow under the pagetitle is gone. Trying to cut down on my blatant abuse of dropshadows here.
* The outer striped gradients has been flipped. It looks nicer this way and I feel it helps leading the eye towards the content.
* The CSS now losely follows the "naming conventions put forth by Andy Clarke(What's in a name (pt2))":http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/archives/whats_in_a_name_pt2.html.
* The document structure has been improved (I hope), based on "Tomas Jogins thoughts about hierarchy(Hierarchy)":http://jogin.com/weblog/archives/2004/07/19/hierarchy and the comments to his post. 
* The search is now styled, inspired by the technique "detailed by Dave Shea(PHP, CGI and MT: Together at last)":http://mezzoblue.com/archives/2004/07/08/php_cgi_and_/.

So far, all seems well and somewhat better.
