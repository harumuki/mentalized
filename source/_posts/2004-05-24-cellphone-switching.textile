<img src="/files/journal/cellphone_switching/nokia2ericsson.jpg" class="right" alt="Switching phones" />After having lived with "a primitive brick of a cellphone(Nokia 3210)":http://www.nokia.com/cda1/0,4267,118,00.html for years I have finally invested in and switched to a sleek, hi-tech (well, higher-tech at least) "Sony Ericsson T610(Sony Ericsson T610)":http://www.sonyericsson.com/spg.jsp?cc=dk&amp;lc=da&amp;ver=4000&amp;template=pp1_1_1&amp;zone=pp&amp;lm=pp1&amp;pid=10055. So far I am very satisified, now where do I get games for it...

Update: Oh, and when I am done playing games on it, I will call all my friends on their cellphones. Together we will try to figure out exactly how us paying for phones with money we've earned by working makes us spoiled. Then we'll figure out what 5 year old trend we will follow next...
