After 6 months of "evangelizing and advocating":http://mentalized.net/journal/2006/05/14/one-day-with-scott-raymond/, followed by "6 more months of rewriting":http://mentalized.net/journal/2007/01/02/after-the-rewrite/, and then 3 more months of building new features and enhancing existing ones, we have finally launched "the new version of BiQ":http://www.biq.dk.

<a href="http://www.biq.dk">!/files/journal/biq_on_rails/biq_homepage_2007.jpg!</a>

Going from ASP/VBScript on Windows 2000 and IIS to Ruby and Rails on Debian served with love by Apache proxy balancing to a Mongrel backend, using memcached for relieving the database of those common queries, with continuous integration provided by Cruise Control and easy deployment through Capistrano sure as heck feels good.

Add to that the fact that the new look is quite delicious and powered by standards compliant XHTML sprinkled with a tiny amount of Ajax and a hint of microformats and Atom feeds, and has a "blog":http://www.biq.dk/blog and some new "killer features":http://www.biq.dk/tour/network and you'll probably understand why I am happy.

Now it is time to make the site even better. ;)
