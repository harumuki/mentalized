With the end of November also comes the end of submissions for the "ReUSEIT! design contest(ReUSEIT!)":http://builtforthefuture.com/reuseit/index.php . Not surprisingly, I never actually got around to finishing my own entry so you will have to settle for the "50 something entries(ReUSEIT! Contest Entries)":http://builtforthefuture.com/reuseit/contestants.php ranging from hideous to nice.

As always, it is interesting to see how different - and alike - the same page can end up looking when different minds design.
