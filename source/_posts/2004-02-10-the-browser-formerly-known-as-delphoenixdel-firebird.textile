So this weekend brought us "Thunderbird 0.5(Thunderbird)":http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/ and "Firebird 0.8(Firefox)":http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/ - Oops, I mean Fire_fox_ 0.8. Yup, that's right, once again a new name (and a nice "new logo(Branding Firefox)":http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/archives/000377.php). So in the future, when referring to Firefox on this website, I mean the browser, _not_ "Kevin Karpenske's website(FireFox.com)":http://www.firefox.com/, "the fireworks factory(Firefox Enterprises)":http://www.firefox-fx.com/, the "manufacturer of vehicular fire protection(Firefox Industries)":http://firefoxind.com/2/, "the Clint Eastwood Movie(IMDb: Firefox (1982))":http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083943/, or the "fireworks with attitude(Firefox Fireworks)":http://www.pyrotechnicschina.com/. 

With a bunch of "new features(Firefox 0.8 release notes)":http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/releases/ - including an installer for us Windows users, the number of excuses for still using IE is getting delightfully low.
