From "Reuters":http://in.today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=worldNews&storyID=2006-01-31T043203Z_01_NOOTR_RTRJONC_0_India-234553-1.xml&archived=False

bq. Denmark warned its citizens on Monday to avoid Saudi Arabia, and gunmen in Gaza said any Scandinavians there risked attack, as Muslim fury mounted over newspaper cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad.

I wish I understood the mentality that makes someone feel it is proper to physically assault an innocent human being based on the actions of someone else.

I wish I understood the logic behind holding someone responsible for laws that don't adhere to that person, and the logic that leads to expecting someone to follow a personal belief that the person doesn't share.

I wish people would get a grip.

bq. If everybody in the world loved everybody in the world, what a glorious world it could be.
