Creating slim, cross-browser div's with a height of only a few pixels proves to be not as simple as one would think when you add Internet Explorer to the mix of browsers (gee, don't you just love that browser).

Gecko-browsers renders this piece of code

bc. <div style="height: 2px;"></div>

as a div with a height of exactly 2 pixels, while IE decides to make it 12+ pixels tall. It turns out that IE sets the height of the div to exactly 1em (it even scales when you change font-size). It seems IE always inserts a character into a div.

To create a 2 pixels tall div in IE, use the overflow attribute:

bc. div {
   height: 2px;
   overflow: hidden;
}

Voila, 2 pixels tall div in IE and better. An example can be found "here(CSS: Slim div's)":http://www.mentalized.net/playground/css/slimbar.html .
