Hm, I have nothing to post really (I still need to get used to simply writing), so I'll just update people on what is happening in my lack of life currently:
<ul>
<li>Being sick and tired of working 60-70 hours per week</li>
<li>Bought a sleek, new Pentium 4 Northwood 1.8Ghz CPU, 512MB RAM, installed Windows XP and love it all</li>
<li>My <a href="http://www.povarpta.org">Everquest-guild</a> has changed name and direction (interesting eh?)</li>
<li>Released a new version of my <a href="/docs/projects/j-uptime/">J-Uptime-plugin</a> - the first bug was found 5 minutes later :)</li>
<li>Started looking into playing a bit with <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rss-dev/files/namespace.html">RSS</a> - I bet it is useful for something</li>
<li>I really need to do the dishes - can't see my kitchen table anymore</li>
</ul>
