An entry I found laying about as a draft. I probably never published this because it really isn't that original nor funny, ah well...

# You always carry at least 5-6 bags with you
# You try to deposit bags of spider webs, bodyparts and clothing in your bank.
# You tap your shoes when you are in a hurry
# When moving into a new area you pause for a few minutes
# You rely on your safe fall instead of taking the elevator 
# You try to loot roadkill
# You shout "TRAIN" whenever you see more than 3 people following each other
# You send text messages to people standing next to you
# You believe randoming or duelling solves every dispute
