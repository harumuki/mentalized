One good thing about the tourist season is the influx of open-minded, untainted opinions that tourists bring with them. It is refreshing to ride the bus or walk down the street and overhearing two tourists get excited over some mundane detail of the house you pass every day. That boring signalpost you don't notice as part of your daily routine becomes a point of interest to people seeing it with fresh eyes and a clean slate.

Wipe the slate clean, then take a walk through your town. Notice the things you usually don't.
