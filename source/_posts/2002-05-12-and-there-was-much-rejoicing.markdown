I got my first comment! Straight out of nowhere, <a href="http://www.pleimert.dk/troels/">Troels</a> decided to comment on my <a href="/journal/2002/04/30/dont-do-sigs/">rant against graphical signatures</a>. This is not actually the first comment on my blog, but it is the first made by a person I do not know - does this mean that there actually are people reading this piece of unorganized and poorly written mumbojumbo?
