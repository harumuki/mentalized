Pixar strikes again. "Finding Nemo(IMDb: Finding Nemo)":http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266543/ is a great movie. 

The tale of daddy clownfish travelling through the ocean to find his lost son is catching, the characters are all fittingly fishy in their own unique ways, and the voice acting works very well.

The animators have obviously had tons of fun creating the lush, colorful, underwater enviroments and models and it shows. Each scene is saturated with colors, movement and tiny details that makes the movie a visual joy to see.

And let's not forget that it's funny. Sure, it may not exactly be Shrek-style adult humour, but as long as your inner child have not packed its bags and left for greener pastures, you should be able to find several things to send you into minutes of laughter. I know I did.

Grab your tiny nephew, call the local Rent-a-kid, or set up a daycare center - anything works as an excuse to see this movie.
