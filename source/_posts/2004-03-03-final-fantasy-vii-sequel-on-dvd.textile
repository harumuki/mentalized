Seeing how I am currently playing through Final Fantasy VII to finally finish a game I first played 6 years ago and have restarted playing 6 or 7 times since, the news of a coming Final Fantasy movie are pretty interesting.

!/journal/2004/03/03/final_fantasy_vii_sequel_on_dvd/ff7ac.jpg(Cloud)!

The coming full length movie, "Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children(IMDb: Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children)":http://imdb.com/title/tt0385700/, apparently picks up where the game ends, and is - like "the previous Final Fantasy movie(IMDb: Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within)":http://imdb.com/title/tt0173840/ - going to be fully CG animated. The "trailers (Advent Children trailers)":http://www.adventchildren.net/ff7ac/media/movies.htm look great and several "characters(Advent Children.net characters)":http://www.adventchildren.net/ff7ac/movie/characters.htm from the game reappear.

Here's hoping that they manage to make the story vastly more interesting than the one in The Spirits Within, but building on the story from the game should provide a great foundation for making a movie that is more than simply overdimensioned swords and excessive visual effects.
