I thought "Google Maps":http://maps.google.com were cool. Now Google has bridged the gap between desktop and server app and "brings you the world":http://earth.google.com in it's full, texture mapped 3D glory with buildings and terrain raising out of the 2D surface making the world look like a game of Sim City. And the basic editions is free. 

I still haven't found my jaw.
