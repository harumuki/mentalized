Sigh, with <a href="http://www.planesofpower.com">the newest EverQuest-expansion</a> hitting the gamingstore shelves and the online servers yesterday, we should've seen this coming: Massive downtime. It is no surprise that Sony/VI cannot release a major expansion without having to bring all the servers down. For the last 3 days they have been down more than they've been up. I am closing in on a week without EverQuest, I can feel the shakes already.
