The big geeky story around the blogosphere these days is the new "Google Suggest(Google)":http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1 feature.

Drew McLellan takes you "behind the scenes(XMLHttpRequest)":http://allinthehead.com/retro/241/, Adam Stiles looks at and "hacks" "the technical side of Google Suggest(Hacking Google Suggest)":http://www.adamstiles.com/adam/2004/12/hacking_google_.html, and Kevin Gibbs who made the feature "talks about(Google Blog: I've got a suggestion)":http://www.google.com/googleblog/2004/12/ive-got-suggestion.html how the idea stems from a lunch table conversation to a new service from "Google Labs(Google Labs)":http://labs.google.com/.

Remember though, this is not something new or revolutionary. A "Sitepoint article(Make Life Easy With Autocomplete Textboxes)":http://www.sitepoint.com/article/life-autocomplete-textboxes from 2003 talks about this, as does "this Apple Developer article(Remote Scripting with IFRAME)":http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/iframe.html (which dates back to primo 2002 "it seems(geek ramblings)":http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2002/01/28/remote-scripting-with-iframe - what's with the having no date on content :o/). While the execution of the techniques might not be 100% identical, the concept is.

Having a BigCo player like Google take such a visible advantage of this technique, hopefully means more people will be inclined to step up and do the same in their own projects. I am looking forward to seeing how this will be implemented in non-search-related areas.
