Yesterday the daylight savings period ended as it does every year. I managed to mess it up as I do every year. This year I failed to set my alarm clock, resulting in me coming to work an hour early dammit!

Apart from the fun we get from people like me messing up, I wonder why exactly do we employ this daylight savings system? Could we not simply decide to put the time in between the two timeframes (so we would have put our clocks back half an hour this time) and leave it there?
