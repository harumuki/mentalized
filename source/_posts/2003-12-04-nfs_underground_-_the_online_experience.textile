A guide to playing "Need for Speed: Underground(EA GAMES | Need for Speed Underground)":http://www.eagames.com/official/nfs/underground/us/home.jsp in too many easy steps:

# Connect to the online part
# Choose username
# Realize you have to accept the terms of usage _again_, accept them
# Choose username
# Choose your car
# Verify that you have chosen the right car
# Choose the kind of race you want
# Locate a chatroom with free space in a list of hundreds of chatrooms
# Find the list of created games
# Hope you are able to get into a game before it fills the 4 slots
# Hope the creator of the game actually starts the game before people leave again
# Hope you don't get the dreaded "cannot connect to the host"-message that noone really know what means. If you do, go to 7
# Look at a silly textmessage and not the nice looking cars while waiting for all 4 people to connect.
# Pray that none of the opponents are one of the way too many online cheaters
# Win the race
# Pray that you actually won the race and not some other player that you just couldn't see on your screen
# Wonder why you didn't get the points you just won
# Go to 7 - alternativly log off, wondering why anyone bothers playing it online

The singleplayer part is kickass though.
