One of the things that really surprised me was the amount of Mac laptops. I'm not sure I recall a single presenter using a non-Mac laptop, but there were also quite a few among the audience. And boy, is a Mac a great system for these kind of things. Bonjour, Rendevouz, WiFi, SubEthaEdit, Bluetooth, all merges into one big pile of mmmm. Just check out "the contact list":https://flickr.com/photos/heilemann/18507529/ snapped by "Michael Heilemann":http://binarybonsai.com.

Lots of good talks on lots of diverse subjects (perhaps a bit too diverse), tons of interesting people.

Finding a common thread for the speeches and ideas put forth there is kinda hard, but if I hard to sum it up, I think my conclusion would be, that "the ways ahead" are

* Systems that supports social needs of users
* Letting people shape information
* Openness, interoperability
* "Good enough" is actually good enough

Oh, that and the fact, that I suck at networking - I hear it's kinda big at these things.
