Being a wee, humble programmer working on a comparativly small project like "BiQ(BiQ)":http://www.biq.dk, it is somehow comforting to read a Blizzard programmer "publically state(WoW beta gameplay discussion)":http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-general&t=21552#post21552 about a feature he did on World of Warcraft:

bq. [...]I had to implement that. I probably screwed it up somehow[...]

Makes me feel not so bad for introducing the bugs I do, and it's an archtypical example of the defenses developers usually set up when talking about their works.
