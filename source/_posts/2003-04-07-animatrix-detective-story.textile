Ick, I had forgotten about this - luckily <a href="http://www.dualmind.dk" title="dualmind">my brother</a> <a href="http://www.dualmind.dk/archive.asp?id=28" title="dualmind">brought it to my attention</a>.

With the beginning of a new month comes the next freely availabe installment of <a href="http://www.intothematrix.com/" title="The Animatrix">the Animatrix</a>: A Detective Story (I would love to link directly, but they are using a frames setup, sorry).

The episode is a very nice piece of Cartoon Noire with plenty of more or less obvious references to the Matrix universe as we know it. In my opinion this is by far the better of the existing Animatrix episodes, with its own unique style and feel, and a decent story going. It even features a method of "debugging" that's even more gross than the bellybutton method featured in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0133093" title="IMDb: The Matrix">the movie</a>.
