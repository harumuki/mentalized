Today, on #rubyonrails, a stubborn developer insisted on storing phone numbers as integers. The rest of the channel tried to persuade him/her that this was a really, really bad idea. Part of the conversation went:

bq. &lt;Cyanshade&gt; you assume that all phones are in the US?
&lt;stubborn_dev_02&gt; yes
&lt;Cyanshade&gt; my phone number is in the form +358 44 123 4567
&lt;stubborn_dev_02&gt; then i'd ban you

(Name has been changed to protect the innocent)
