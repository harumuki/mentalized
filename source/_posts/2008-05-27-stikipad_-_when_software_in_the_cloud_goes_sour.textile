For a long time I have been using a wiki service called "Stikipad":http://stikipad.com to jot down things I wanted to save for later; like business ideas, drafts for blog posts and presentations, stuff like that.

Unfortunately Stikipad has looked like this the last 2 weeks or so:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jakobs/2527867080/" title="Stikipad silence by JakobS, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2006/2527867080_141acc2c26.jpg" width="500" height="420" alt="Stikipad silence" /></a>

This essentially means I cannot get at my data and have not been able to for weeks now. As if that isn't bad enough in itself, I don't know squat about what is happening, why a data center move is taking weeks to complete, or when I might see my data again. 


h2. The sound of silence

The owners of Stikipad, "Jonathan George":http://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathandavidgeorge and "Matthew DeWaal":http://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewdewaal, "appear to have hid themselves":http://zaissianlogic.com/design/2008/03/what-happened-to-stikipad/ behind a wall of silence which is even scarier - not to mention disrespectful to their customers. 

While I can understand the sticky situation they might be finding themselves in, they need to pull their heads out their butts for a second and provide information to their customers. They haven't answered emails, they "don't reply to comments":http://jdg.net/post/34244694/just-like-to-show-some-appreciation#disqus_thread, and their "support site":http://support.stikipad.com is down. 

At least "a thousand people":http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=%22Powered+by+Stikipad%22&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8 used to have public wikis hosted with Stikipad and are now left with only a non-informative "We are moving data centers". Fine, move data centers all you want, I really don't care. But I do care about my data, which you are currently keeping away from me. 

And to add insult to injury, Stikipad is apparently "charging their customers for a non existant service":http://zaissianlogic.com/design/2008/03/what-happened-to-stikipad/. 


h2. If you're using web applications...

There a couple of lessons to be learned here - both as a consumer and a producer of "cloud services". To the consumers out there looking for the next new thing to make their online life easier, I say

* Don't sign up for a service that doesn't allow you to get your data out of the system in a structured way. To Stikipads credit, they did provide that feature, and I do have a fairly recent backup, so this is probably not a total disaster for me.
* Use that backup/export feature! Use it regularly and not only when you want to cancel your account - I did not, shame on me.


h2. If you're producing web applications...

The most important lesson for producers of web applications that deal with other peoples data - and I sure hope the Stikipad guys are taking notes here so they don't end up accidentally screwing more people over - is that you need to always communicate. Especially in times of trouble. Set up a blog on one of the numerous blogging services or hook your company up with "Get Satisfaction":http://getsatisfaction.com. 

I don't care how you do it, just don't shut the fuck up.
