As you probably know, the Mozilla Firefox browser hit 1.0 yesterday and was released under high traffic-pressure and much attention.

Some stuff written around the net:

And it seems my tab settings has once again become messed up, sigh. +Update: Seems having the Tabbrowser Extensions extension installed caused some undesirable effects with the tab bar. Once removed everything works smoothly, and Firefox 1.0 can do on it's own what I wanted Tabbrowser Extensions for anyways.+
