<p>With Mark Pilgrim <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/03/25/web_site_optimization_review.html" title="Web Site Optimization review">diving into website optimization</a> I decided to run this site
through a <a title="Web site analysis report - WebSiteOptimization.com"
href="http://www.websiteoptimization.com/services/analyze/">size
analysis tool</a>. The verdict:</p>

<blockquote
cite="http://www.websiteoptimization.com/cgi-bin/wso/wso.pl">
  <ul>
    <li>TOTAL_OBJECTS - Congratulations, the total objects on this page
(including the HTML) is 4 which most browsers can multithread.
Minimizing HTTP requests is key for web site optimization.</li>
    <li>TOTAL_IMAGES - Congratulations, the total number of images on
this page is 2. Most browsers can send multiple requests, which can
speed display of multiple images.</li>
    <li>TOTAL_CSS - Congratulations, the total number of external CSS
files on this page is 1. Because external CSS files must be in the HEAD
of your HTML document, they must load first before any BODY content
displays. Although they are cached, CSS files slow down the initial
display of your page.</li>
    <li>TOTAL_SIZE - Caution. The total size of this page is 71995
bytes, which will load in over 8 seconds on a 56Kbps modem. Consider
reducing total page size to less than 30K to achive sub eight second
response times on 56K connections. Be sure to provide feedback for pages
over 30K by layering your design to display useful content within the
first two seconds.</li>
    <li>HTML_SIZE - Caution. The total size of this HTML file is 30437
bytes, which is above 20K but below 100K. With a 10K ad and a logo this
means that your page will load in over 8.6 seconds. Consider optimizing
your HTML and eliminating unnecessary features. To give your users
feedback, consider layering your page to display useful content within
the first two seconds. Consider using HTTP compression (otherwise known
as "content encoding") to reduce the size of your HTML.</li>
    <li>IMAGES_SIZE - Warning! Danger Will Robinson! The total size of
your images is 32673 bytes, which is over 30K. Consider optimizing your
images for size, combining them, and replacing graphic rollovers with
CSS.</li>
    <li>SCRIPT_SIZE - Congratulations, the total size of all your
scripts is 1133 bytes, which is less than 1160 bytes. This will fit into
one higher-speed TCP/IP packet.</li>
    <li>CSS_SIZE - Warning! Danger Will Robinson! The total size of your
external CSS is 8885 bytes, which is over 4K. Consider optimizing your
CSS for size, and combining them. </li>
  </ul>

<p>Ouch, total size: 72KB!</p>

<!--more-->

<p>It's not like this page is particularly complex, but living the last
few years with phat pipes to the Internet has made me not worry about
file sizes.</p>

<p>The header graphic weighs at 31KB and could probably reduced quite a
bit, but I have never bothered. Time to load up Photoshop again.</p>

<p>The most surprising result was my HTML weighing around 30KB - almost
as much as the image. I am not sure what to do about this, I am not even
sure if I want to do anything about it.</p>

<p>Sure, I could create classes with smaller names (which would reduce
CSS size too), but I prefer my sources to be readable. I do have a lot
of needless linebreaks that could be removed though. Perhaps I should
reconsider using extended entries more than I already do (consider it
done).</p>

<p>But is it really worth messing with? Do users really care that a
website loads in 5 seconds instead of 6? I somehow doubt it, unless
we're talking minute long waits. I'd dare guessing, that people have
become used to long waits on the web and tend to get pleasantly
surprised when a page loads in less than 2 seconds, instead of getting
pissed when it takes 12.</p>

<p>For a site like <a href="http://www.google.com" title="Go to Google">Google</a> shaving a few bytes off their frontpage would probably result in a noticably lowered bandwidth bill. 

<p>For me, the results are only mildly interesting. It isn't something I am going to do a lot about, but at least I know I may have a problem the day I get several thousand visitors a day - as in never.</p>
