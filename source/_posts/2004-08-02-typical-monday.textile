::Groan:: It seems today is going to be "one of those days":

* Got up way too late
* Dropped my cereal all over the kitchen floor
* One of our nightly jobs at work hadn't run properly
* Poured coffee into my glass of water
* Dropped a Post-It pad into my glass of water
* A tool we use regularly decided to start crashing every time we did a routine task using it
* I spilled coffee on my desk and keyboard

And the time hasn't even passed 10:30 yet.
