I received an email from a spammer over the weekend. There's nothing special about that, I receive several hundred of those daily.

However this one appeared to have been sent directly to me, it contained nothing that looked like it was actually promoting anything, no links, nothing but a simple message:

bq. "Anti-spammers are lamers"

Signed by "a spammer".

Oh wow, such an amazing display of wits. How can we possibly imagine to ever defeat the scumbags when they have such dazzling argumentative powers aided by a strong belief in publically standing by their own actions?
