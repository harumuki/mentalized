For many years I have had a christmas tradition: Over the vacation I would build a small hobby project for fun. The last few years have had me lounging in the couch at my parents place, writing small games. This year was no different.

[Play now (control with arrow keys, shoot with space)](http://playground.mentalized.net/superbrix/).

[SuperBrix](http://playground.mentalized.net/superbrix) is inspired by a game called [Jetbrix](http://plus4world.powweb.com/software/Jetbrix), which I remember from my very first computer, a [Commodore 16](https://www.google.com/search?q=commodore+16&tbm=isch). I don't remember much other than it featured guy with a jetpack and he flew around shooting bricks falling from the sky. So that was the mechanic I implemented.

## Phaser.io

Being a Rubyist, I have played around with a few Ruby-based game frameworks, most notably [Gosu](http://www.libgosu.org/). Recently, though, the rise of canvas and WebGL has made the lure of building games that run in the browser quite tempting.

This year I stumbled across [Phaser.io](http://phaser.io/); a 2D game framework that comes with a bunch of good stuff. Sprite sheets, animations, particles, game stages/states, fixed timestep game loop, everything you need to put together a 2D game.

I quite like Phaser.io so far. For a small game like mine it has worked just fine, and I definitely recommend checking it out if you have Javascript chops and want to experiment with writing games.

And please, make sure to show the rest of us what you make.
