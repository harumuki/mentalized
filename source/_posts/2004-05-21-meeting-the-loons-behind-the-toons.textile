This recent weekend 3 danes, 4 hungarians, and 6 british people met in Copenhagen. For a lot of them this was their first meeting eachother, and the only common denominator was that they all play EverQuest together.

The weekend marked a milestone in my EverQuest experience. The fact that 13 people, who only knew eachother from an online enviroment, could get together, spend an entire weekend (and then some) and simply "connect" was a great experience.

Tons of fun was had, good food was eaten, beers were drunk and EverQuest puns were numerous. I'd do this again anytime - and will be this coming weekend, although on a smaller scale.
