Movable Type 2.6 <a title="movabletype.org" href="http://www.movabletype.org/">has been released</a> and is now running on this site. It has a bunch of <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/docs/mtchanges.html#2.6%20(2003.02.13)">fixes and new features</a>. Updating went without a hitch (so far at least) - now I only need to remove the plugins that have been deprecated.

<ins datetime="2003-02-24"><strong>Update</strong>: Bugfixes and security patches have been released since I originally wrote this post: <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/news/2003_02.shtml#000787" title="Version 2.61 released">2.61</a>,  <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/news/2003_02.shtml#000797" title="Vulnerability in 2.6 and 2.61">2.62</a>, <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/news/2003_02.shtml#000803" title="Version 2.63 released, nightly builds">2.63</a>.</ins>
