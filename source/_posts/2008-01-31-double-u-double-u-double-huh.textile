It's about time we kill the "www". I don't mean the World Wide Web, obviously, but the three letters that appear at the beginning of a plethora of website addresses.

Seen from a human perspective they serve very little purpose these days. Sure, many people believe they are required - and in some cases they are due to technical oversights - and will happily enter them in the address bar.

It could be argued that they make it easy to recognize a website address. I agree, everybody recognizes "www.example.com" as a website address. However, my guess is that people are just as likely to recognize "example.com". The dot and the 2-4 letters following it are what makes a website address - both on a technical level, but also in peoples minds.


h2. Why it's bad

bq. The World Wide Web is the only thing I know of whose shortened form takes three times longer to say than what it's short for.
