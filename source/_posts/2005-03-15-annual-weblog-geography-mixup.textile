My geography must be somewhat rusty. Last I checked, both the United Kingdoms and Ireland were part of Europe, and Canada and Latin America was placed on the American continent. 

"The Annual Weblog Awards(Fifth Annual Weblog Awards)":http://2005.bloggies.com/ seems to think otherwise though, with separate categories for "European", "British or Irish", "Latin American", "Canadian", and "American" weblogs. It's a shame that in the online world, where geographical borders have all the opportunity to not be important, we cling to ancient beliefs and award prizes based on geographical separation.

Ah well, more categories means more winners, which is a great thing - big congratulations to them :)
