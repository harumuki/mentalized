Before you do anything else, go to "fluxiom.com":http://fluxiom.com and check out their video. Then realize this; It's a web application.

Holy crap! I can't wait to see it in action. If indeed the interface and interaction is as the movie shows, this is probably the closest to a webbased desktop application we've ever been. It looks like something straight out of the Apple application shop. Go "wollzelle":http://www.wollzelle.com/!

Ofcourse, nothing less is to be expected with mr. script.aculo.us himself, Thomas Fuchs, on the team. He shares "some more details about Fluxiom":http://mir.aculo.us/articles/2005/11/24/fluxiom on his weblog.

Talk about raising the bar for the rest of us dabblers.
