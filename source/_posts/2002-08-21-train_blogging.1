I am currently sitting in a train with my laptop doing my Travelling Businessman Impression. Outside the window the danish countryside with its colorful cropfields and lush, green forests is rushing by, providing a sharp contrast to the sounds of the new Eminem album filling my ears.

Last night I went to a party with some of my cousins and it got quite late before we emptied our last beers and headed for home. As a result, I got way too little sleep before I had to get up in order to catch this train, naturally resulting in me falling asleep on the train.

If there is one thing you can be certain of when sleeping in any sort of public transportation, it is that you have looked immensely stupid doing so, your head tilted back, mouth wide open with a little drool down your chin - pure Homer-style. At least I didn't snore... I think.
