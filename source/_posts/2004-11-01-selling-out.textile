Yup, it had to happen sooner or later. I've sold out. Soon the vastly popular "Mentalized.net(mentalized.net)":http://mentalized.net/ will consist of nothing but graphical and noisy ads popping up and over and under, you'll be spammed, offered to install spywayre and you'll be harassed by Viagra vendors.

Or perhaps I've added a single "Google AdSense(AdSense)":http://www.google.com/adsense ad in the sidebar on my entries. It's not something I expect to get rich on, truth be told I'll be surprised if I ever see any money from this, but I wanted to get some hands-on experience, and that's (partly) what mentalized.net is for.
